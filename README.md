# BIT608-AS1_AS2
TODO:
Data sanitization
Registration
Remove jQuery bloat

KNOWN ISSUES:
Editing a booking -> room availability does not include currently selected room (changing date removes existing selected room from options)
"The login page should interact and work with the existing BnB code from the Motueka.zip folder." <--- Nope...


NOTES:

users:
admin@admin.com // admin
all other users password = "."

booking.room = room.roomID (this is preferred and not incorrect.)
